People have tendency to write the linked list for fun/practice, I am creating ORMs.

The repo is a valid MySQL/MariaDB ORM for Python. The future roadmap assumes PostgreSQL and SQLite support, the others are not considered yet.

## Why exists?
The yet another approach to avoid SQLAlchemy or any other heavy ORM.

## When to use?
You might consider using `sqls-py`, if any of the following is about you:
- SQLAlchemy is too slow
- tortoise-orm is not what you enjoy
- you tried both libs mentioned above, and looking for something else
- pydantic is what you like
- you are unhappy duplicating your FastAPI schemas as SQL models
- the provided capability covers your project needs
- simple, flat, fast, easy to use as a core for the fork

## When not to use?
- `slqs-py` is the first ORM you ever saw
- you are looking for a project maintained by thousands
